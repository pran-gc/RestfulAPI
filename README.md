# RESTful API Learning Project

A hands-on educational project for learning RESTful API development with ASP.NET MVC. Features interactive web interface for testing API endpoints and progressive exercises for students.

## üéØ Overview

This project provides a complete learning environment for understanding RESTful API concepts through practical implementation. Students work with a product inventory system that demonstrates all four CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with proper HTTP methods and status codes.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Web Interface** - Swagger-like testing interface for all endpoints
- **4 Complete Demo Examples** - Working implementations for reference
- **16 Progressive Exercises** - From beginner to advanced challenges
- **Real-time Testing** - Immediate feedback for API calls
- **In-memory Data Storage** - No database setup required
- **Proper HTTP Methods** - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with correct status codes
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error responses and validation

## üìÅ Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller.cs              # Main controller with demos and exercises
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.cs                   # Product and Customer data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ view.cshtml               # Interactive testing interface

```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Teachers

1. Use `controller.cs` for demonstrations (includes completed solutions)
3. Open `view.cshtml` in DotNetFiddle for interactive testing

### For Students

2. Study the 4 demo methods (fully implemented)
3. Implement the 16 exercise methods
4. Test your solutions using the web interface

### DotNetFiddle Setup

1. Go to [dotnetfiddle.net](https://dotnetfiddle.net)
2. Create new MVC project
3. Copy the controller, model, and view files
4. Run and test your API endpoints

## üìö Learning Path

### Demo Methods (Pre-built Examples)
- `GetAllProducts()` - Retrieve all products
- `AddProduct()` - Create new product
- `UpdateProduct()` - Modify existing product  
- `DeleteProduct()` - Remove product

### Student Exercises

#### GET Endpoints (4 exercises)
- **Easy**: Get product by ID
- **Easy**: Get products by category
- **Medium**: Search products with filters
- **Challenge**: Get products in price range

#### POST Endpoints (4 exercises)
- **Easy**: Add product with duplicate name validation
- **Easy**: Add customer (different entity)
- **Medium**: Add product with required field validation
- **Challenge**: Add product with price range validation

#### PUT Endpoints (4 exercises)
- **Easy**: Update product name only
- **Easy**: Update product price only
- **Medium**: Update product with full validation
- **Challenge**: Update product with business rules

#### DELETE Endpoints (4 exercises)
- **Easy**: Delete product by name
- **Easy**: Delete customer by ID
- **Medium**: Delete with existence checks
- **Challenge**: Delete with business rule validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Models

    public int Stock { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

### HTTP Methods Used
- **GET** - Retrieve data
- **POST** - Create new resources
- **PUT** - Update existing resources
- **DELETE** - Remove resources

### Status Codes Covered
- `200 OK` - Successful GET/PUT/DELETE
- `201 Created` - Successful POST
- `400 Bad Request` - Validation errors
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `409 Conflict` - Business rule violations
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server errors

## üéì Learning Objectives

By completing this project, students will learn:
